    <h1>Lesson 4: An intro to CSS</h1>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets</p>
    <p>While <b>HTML</b> is used to describe the <i>content</i> of a webpage, <b>CSS</b> is used to present the content. In other words it makes things look good.</p>
    <h2>CSS Classes</h2>
    <p>CSS can interact with the HTML that you write through something called a <i>class</i>. A class is a structure that contains various <i>properties</i> and can be applied to a range of elements. This means that I can make multiple parts of the HTML look the same without writing code over and over.</p>
    <p>A CSS class name must always start with a dot. Example:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>.my-classname</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      A CSS class will always have braces in which its <i>properties</i> will reside.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .my-classname {
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>CSS <i>properties</i> will go between the braces. <b>Properties</b> are rules that anything within that specific CSS class will follow.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        .text--red {
          color: #ff0000;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>How to mix CSS with HTML</h2>
    <p>Just writing CSS itself doesn't do anything. We must also include the CSS file in the HTML. We do this using linked files like we learned about in lesson 2.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;html>
          &lt;head>
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
          &lt;/head>
        &lt;/html>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This still doesn't do anything. We have to actually make sure that our HTML knows that the CSS classes exist, otherwise they won't take affect.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;div class="text--red">
            <p>This is some exciting text</p>
          &lt;/div>
        &lt;/body>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <style>
      .text--red {
        color: #ff0000;
      }
    </style>
    <div class="text--red">
      <p>This is some exciting text</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
