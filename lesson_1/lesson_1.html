    <h1>Code Accelerator - Lesson 1</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.</p>
    <p>HTML is essentially the thing that makes text and photos show up on websites.</p>
    <p>HTML is markup - it is NOT code. Writing HTML is like using Microsoft Word, but instead of clicking buttons you have to use something called <i>tags</i>.</p>

    <h2>Tags</h2>
    <p>An HTML tag is very simple: it is a letter or word between two angle braces.</p>
    <p>An angle brace is what we call the greater than (&gt;) and less than (&lt;) symbols. An HTML tag looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>I am going to show you a few other tags. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how HTML works and be able to write and format text in a website.</p>
    <h3>Tag examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> makes text <b>bold</b></li>
      <li><code>&lt;i&gt;</code> makes text <b>italic</b></li>
      <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the biggest heading you can use in HTML. It looks like <h1>this</h1></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
